#v 0.1.0

New dev version

# v0.0.0

Palette works and so do the react Provider / HOC (I think) but went
overboard with the examples.
Not sure if getting false positives in tests or not. When I tried
this out in another project the example react table failed,
could be due to the way it's bundled with rollup not sure, think I
might just use plain babel for builds and maybe drop example at this stage,
it was an attempt to see if it works as expected but not sure its a good test.
